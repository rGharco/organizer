# organizer
A bash script made to organize files easier and interactively

 #CREATOR'S NOTE

        Hello, and thank you for checking out my project. This was a simple home assigment for my Linux classes for

        college but I ended up growing on it and now I kind of want to show it to the world. The code was not planned

        ahead so there might be some ineficiency in it but I am always listening for suggestions and ways to improve it

        so if you want to help me with it, hit me up.


  #USAGE

        The program was created with the purpose in mind of using it in a central folder from which you can either

        navigate to other directories and organize stuff there or simply organize the stuff inside your current folder.

        The advanced search is for file extensions while the normal one is for keywords. Besides that there really

        isn't much to explain to it. Just make sure when you type the directory you type "directory_destination/subdir

        otherwise there will be an error if you type "/directory".


  #FUTURE UPDATES & PROJECTS

        For now this is all I have in mind but at a later time I might do some other projects if you would be interested

        If you have any tips on how I can improve it or other functionalities you would like, let me know.

        Have a wonderfull day!
